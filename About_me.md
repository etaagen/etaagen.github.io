## ABOUT ME  

Hi there- I am currently a Plant Breeding and Genetics PhD candidate at Cornell University in [Dr. Mark Sorrells’](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) Small Grains Breeding and Genetics lab. As a geneticist, I love studying the relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic variation and am driven by their potential to enhance the productivity and health of plants. As a plant breeder, I have developed a passion for connecting the central themes of plant molecular biology and genetics to the needs of breeders and a crop’s value chain.  

I am drawn to career destinations in industry, consulting, or think tanks where scientists are involved in diversified and applied programs of research.
