## ABOUT ME  

Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I am Ella Taagen, and you can call me Ellie. I leverage eight years of experience in biotech data analytics and three years as a data scientist and product manager in commercial agriculture R&D to identify and solve complex problems and translate innovations into products. Openness, interdisciplinary collaboration, and adaptability are core pillars of my creative and critical thinking approach to leadership, teamwork, and customer engagement. I am drawn to career paths at the intersection of **biology and AI**, with a commitment to sustainability for the customer, organization, and planet.

I completed my Ph.D. in Plant Genetics at Cornell University in [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) Small Grains Breeding and Genetics lab, where I led in-silico and in-vivo projects related to the two primary novel sources of genetic variation, recombination and mutation during meiosis. I am currently a data scientist at Bayer collaborating on innovative crop genome editing discovery projets and our data product management.
