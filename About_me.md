## ABOUT ME  

Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I am a Plant Breeding and Genetics PhD candidate at Cornell University in [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) Small Grains Breeding and Genetics lab. As a geneticist, I love exploring the relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic variation and am driven by their potential to enhance plant health and productivity. I am drawn to career paths in industry at the intersection of genetics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology. My anticipated graduation is Spring 2022.
