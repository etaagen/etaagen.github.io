## ABOUT ME  

Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I am currently a Plant Breeding and Genetics PhD candidate at Cornell University in [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) Small Grains Breeding and Genetics lab. As a geneticist, I love exploring the relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic variation and am driven by their potential to enhance plant health and productivity. I am committed to connecting the central themes of molecular biology and genetics to the needs of plant breeders via open-source and interdisciplinary initiatives. My dissertation research focuses on fine-mapping and characterization of a grain morphology gene in wheat and exploring the biological constraints of meiotic recombination in a plant breeding context. I also contribute to the scientific community by advocating for diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM with student leadership roles. I have served as chair of online communications for Cornell Graduate Women in Science and am currently the president of Synapsis, the Cornell Plant Breeding graduate student association. 

I am drawn to career paths in industry, consulting, or think tanks where scientists are involved in diversified and applied programs of research.
