Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I am Ella Taagen, and you can call me Ellie. As a data scientist, I love to model and test the relationships between regulatory genomic features and desirable phenotypes, and seek to further leverage their potential to enhance variant discovery with genome editing. Openness, adaptability, and interdisciplinary communication are core pillars of my creative and critical thinking approach to problem solving and project leadership.    

I completed my Ph.D. in Plant Genetics at Cornell University in [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) Small Grains Breeding and Genetics lab, where I led in-silico and in-vivo projects related to the two primary novel sources of genetic variation, recombination and mutation of genetic material during meiosis. I am currently a data scientist at Bayer collaborating on innovative crop genome editing discovery projets. I am drawn to career paths on research and development teams in the biotech industry at the intersection of **genomics, data science, and project leadership.**
