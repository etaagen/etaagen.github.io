## ABOUT ME  

> Hi there, I am currently a Plant Breeding and Genetics Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University in [Dr. Mark Sorrells’](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) Small Grains Breeding and Genetics lab. As a geneticist, I love studying the relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic variation and am driven by their potential to enhance the productivity and health of plants. As a plant breeder, I have developed a passion for connecting the central themes of plant molecular biology and genetics to the needs of breeders and a crop’s value chain. I am drawn to career destinations in industry, consulting, or think tanks where scientists are involved in diversified and applied programs of research.

## RESEARCH INTERESTS 

> Global food security is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The importance of enhancing the productivity and adaptability of crops motivates me to apply my genetics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology skillset to uncovering the mechanisms driving desirable phenotypes. My doctoral dissertation research embodies these interests and motivations, focused on fine-mapping and cloning a yield component gene in spring wheat. I am leveraging traditional population development strategies, along with cutting-edge tools in genomics/transcriptomics, microscopy, and genome editing to accelerate the identification of the trait’s morphological basis and causal genetic sequence variation. This research is supported by the [USDA NIFA WheatCAP](https://www.triticeaecap.org/).
> 
> Adjacent to my gene mapping research, I have also developed a deep interest in exploring the fundamental regulation of meiotic recombination and increasing resolution of genetic diversity. Manipulating the rate and positions of crossovers to increase the genetic variation accessible to breeders is a longstanding goal for harnessing the power of selection.
