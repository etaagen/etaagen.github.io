## ABOUT ME  

Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I am currently a Plant Breeding and Genetics PhD candidate at Cornell University in [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) Small Grains Breeding and Genetics lab. As a geneticist, I love studying the relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic variation and am driven by their potential to enhance the productivity and health of many species. I have a commitment to connecting the central themes of plant molecular biology and genetics to the needs of plant breeders and a cropâ€™s value chain.  

I am drawn to career paths in industry, consulting, or think tanks where scientists are involved in diversified and applied programs of research.
