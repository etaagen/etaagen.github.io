## ABOUT ME  

Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I am Ella Taagen, and you can call me Ellie. This is a website I made for my Ph.D. research; for more current updates on what I'm up to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/etaagen) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellie-taagen/). I love new challenges and opportunities to leverage data for innovation and strategic impact - letâ€™s connect! 

I completed my Ph.D. in Plant Genetics at Cornell University in [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) Small Grains Breeding and Genetics lab, where I led in-silico and in-vivo projects related to the two primary novel sources of genetic variation, recombination and mutation during meiosis. 

I am currently a data scientist at Bayer collaborating on innovative crop genome editing discovery projets and our data product management.
