## RESEARCH INTERESTS  

* Genetics 🧬

* Bioinformatics 👩‍💻 

* Molecular biology 🧪

* Food security 🌾

Global food security is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The importance of enhancing the productivity and adaptability of crops motivates me to apply my genetics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology skillset to uncovering the mechanisms driving desirable phenotypes.   

My doctoral dissertation research embodies these interests and motivations, focused on fine-mapping and cloning a yield component gene in spring wheat. I am leveraging traditional population development strategies, along with cutting-edge tools in genomics/transcriptomics, microscopy, and genome editing to accelerate the identification of the trait’s morphological basis and causal genetic sequence variation. This research is supported by the [USDA NIFA WheatCAP](https://www.triticeaecap.org/).

Inspired by the challenges of gene mapping, I have also developed a deep interest in exploring the fundamental regulation of meiotic recombination and increasing resolution of genetic diversity. Manipulating the rate and positions of crossovers to increase the genetic variation accessible to breeders is a longstanding goal for harnessing the power of selection.
