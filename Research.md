## RESEARCH INTERESTS  

* Genetics 🧬

* Bioinformatics 👩‍💻 

* Molecular biology 🧪

* Food security 🌾

Global food security is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The importance of enhancing the productivity and adaptability of crops motivates me to apply my genetics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology skillset to uncovering the mechanisms driving desirable phenotypes.   

My doctoral dissertation research embodies these interests and motivations, focused on the biological constraints of meiotic and mitotic recombination in a plant breeding context, and fine-mapping and characterization of a grain morphology gene in wheat. I am leveraging traditional population development strategies, along with cutting-edge tools in genomics and transcriptomics, bioinformatics and simulation methods to better understand the landscape of causal variation and prediction-based breeding decisions. This research is supported by the [USDA NIFA WheatCAP](https://www.triticeaecap.org/).
